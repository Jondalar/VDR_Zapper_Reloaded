VDR Zapper Reloaded

Further details (German only) can be found at vdrportal, thread: http://www.vdr-portal.de/board/thread.php?postid=987995#post987995

Zapper has originally been rewritten from scratch for this by me, I am working on this from time to time when I either feel the need for myself or want to experiment... The next step will be to take the UI a huge step forward and create Paging Views, so the App shall contain a real "zapping screen", a screen targeting recordings and playing them, as well as a configurable view.

Help is welcome and any feedback appreciated.
